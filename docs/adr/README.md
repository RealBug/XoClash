# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) documenting the key architectural decisions made in the XO Clash project.

## What are ADRs?

ADRs are documents that capture important architectural decisions along with their context and consequences. They help future developers understand why certain decisions were made.
